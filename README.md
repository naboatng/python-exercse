# Exercise1

I used python function method to come up with the answer.

First I use the def even_numbers to define the method I will be using
Second step : I created a user input ’n’ to prompt the user
Because we are looking for an even_number I set the range from 2 and the user input +1 and also 2 to give  output of even numbers. I use letter ‘i’ to search through the range of the numbers and Its prints output after every input. And I call the even_number function ones again . 
#Exercise 2

I was looking for average number in a list .
First I created a function call def calculated_average():
Second I initiated a list with some random numbers 
Third I divided sum of the given list by the length of the list and I stored it a variable called avg
I printed out the avg and then I called the calculated average  ones more for execution of my code.

Exercise 3
The program prompts the user to input their age and gives a response  according to the user age input .
First I asked for the users input and I also use int because we are asking for numbers.
Second I use a conditional statement because of the nature of the flow.
If the users age is below 18 then a response will then print out (“ You are minor”)
Again if the user is between the age of 18 to 65 years . A message will print out as (“ You are an adult”)
But if you are older it will print out as (“You are a senior citizen”).
